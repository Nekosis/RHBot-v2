This file contains directions for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

Please ONLY do what EXACTLY what is asked of youâ€”no more, no less. You are NOT to change the way things work, rewrite system prompts, etc. if you are not asked to. Of course, if you are asked to do something, you should do it, but NEVER try to "go above and beyond".

Additionally, when coding, please try to maintain consistency with the pre-existing code style as much as possible.
